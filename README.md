# Clinical-Decision-Support-System
Due to the progress in big data within biomedical and healthcare communities, the accurate study of medical data benefits early disease recognition, patient care, and community services. When the quality of medical data is incomplete, the precision of the study is reduced. Moreover, different regions exhibit unique manifestations of certain regional diseases, which may weaken the prediction of disease outbreaks.

In this project, the implementation involved Machine Learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Perceptron, and Naive Bayes. Structured data from hospitals was used for analysis, and a comparison of the accuracy among these algorithms was conducted."
